## Installation
1. Download the 'UserTags.pluging.js' file
2. Add it to your Better Discord plugins folder

## Usage
### Searching by a tag
To search for users with a specific tag, you can add a `&` character before the tag. You can search for multiple tags by adding a space between the tags. Or even search for users that don't have a tag by adding a `!` character before the tag. For example:
`&admin`
`&admin &mod`
`&admin &mod !bot`
### Adding a tag
To add a tag to a user, open the users profile and click on the `+` button. A new text input will appear where you can add the tag. Tags save automatically as you type.
### Removing a tag
To remove a tag from a user, open the users profile and click on the small `X` button next to the tag.
